These scripts I wrote to aid in performing a "meta study".
They are badly written and I should have used grep or ntlk.
I learned a lot. Perl is lovely.

If I havea enough time I'd like to:
* add webcrawling support
* write out the results based on directory name
* take some cmdline args (would not be hard to implement)
* re-write and actually design it properly
* fail at re-write and start from scratch
